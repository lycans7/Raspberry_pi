kernel compilation and updating the version thru raspbeerry pi
####go to this site for further things
https://www.raspberrypi.org/documentation/linux/kernel/building.md

There are two main methods for building the kernel. 
a .You can build locally on a Raspberry Pi, which will take a long time; 
b .You can cross-compile, which is much quicker, but requires more setup.

Local building :

First install Git and the build dependencies: 
1.  sudo apt-get install git bc

Next get the sources, which will take some time:
 2. git clone --depth=1 https://github.com/raspberrypi/linux

3.  cd linux
in makefile change these things so that in configuration files it can change when u are updated ur kernel.
VERSION = 4
PATCHLEVEL = 28
SUBLEVEL = 10
 
4.  KERNEL=kernel7

# Configure the kernel; as well as the default configuration, 
you may wish to configure your kernel in more detail or apply patches from another source, to add or remove required functionality:

# Configuration is most commonly done through the make menuconfig interface. 
Alternatively, you can modify your .config file manually, but this can be more difficult for new users.

The menuconfig tool requires the ncurses development headers to compile properly. These can be installed with the following command:
5.  sudo apt-get install libncurses5-dev
6.  make menuconfig
The menuconfig utility has simple keyboard navigation. After a brief compilation, you'll be presented with a list of submenus containing all the options you can configure; there's a lot, so take your time to read through them and get acquainted.

#Use the arrow keys to navigate, 
the Enter key to enter a submenu (indicated by  --->), Escape twice to go up a level or exit, 
and the space bar to cycle the state of an option.
Some options have multiple choices, in which case they'll appear as a submenu and the Enter key will select an option.
You can press h on most entries to get help about that specific option or menu.

#Exiting, saving, and loading configurations
Once you're done making the changes you want, press Escape until you're prompted to save your new configuration. 
By default, this will save to the  .config file. You can save and load configurations by copying this file around.

7.  make bcm2709_defconfig
Build and install the kernel, modules, and Device Tree blobs; this step takes a long time:

8.  make -j4 zImage modules dtbs
9.  sudo make modules_install
10. sudo cp arch/arm/boot/dts/*.dtb /boot/
11. sudo cp arch/arm/boot/dts/overlays/*.dtb* /boot/overlays/
12. sudo cp arch/arm/boot/dts/overlays/README /boot/overlays/
13. sudo cp arch/arm/boot/zImage /boot/$KERNEL.img

14. reboot
